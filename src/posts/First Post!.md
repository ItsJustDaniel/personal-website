This is my first blog post. To be honest im kind of nervous about this, i've never been much of a writer in fact i've never been good at articulating my thoughts, i've never shared my thoughts on certain events, politics and religion and really haven't had much of a presence on social media. This has its drawbacks of course, i'm shy and can never speak my mind and even when i do i can never am able to articulate it well, i'm self-conscious and have low self-esteem. I hope that with this blog, i will able improve with some of these things.
I doubt anyone really will be reading this blog, this may as well be sent out to the void, not to be seen from anyone, and that's ok. i only really want to improve my ability to articulate and in fact, if people were to read this i would be much more cautious and overthink things to a point where i couldn't ever write anything in the first place.
So what will i be writing in this blog?
I plan to be writing about my projects where i deepdive into them. how i made them? the challenges i've face. etc. i also plan to be making blogs on what i think of what will come of future technologies. Programming Languages, Frameworks, Libraries. I also plan to explain concepts, although no one will be reading this explaining something can help let a idea stick in your brain and proves that you really know something. and perhaps even, i will be talking about my feelings. my feelings about current events in my lifeâ€“ my fear, my hopes, dreams and frustrations with life.
